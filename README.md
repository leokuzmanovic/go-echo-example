# Your Golang REST Microservice

This is an example Golang REST microservice showcasing best practices for building a RESTful API. The service is built using the following technologies:

- [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo): A high-performance, extensible, minimalist Go web framework.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/): A powerful open-source framework for API development, including a robust set of tools for API design, testing, and documentation.
- [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/): A standard for representing claims securely between two parties.
- [Somber](https://github.com/alaa/somber): A lightweight dependency injection library for Go.
- [Mockery]: Mocks were generated using https://vektra.github.io/mockery/latest/
